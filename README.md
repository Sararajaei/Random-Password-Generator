# Random Password Generator

This project is a simple program that generates a random and secure password for you using the Python programming language.
## Installation

First, make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from the python.org website.

After installing Python, to run the program, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Then, run the following command:
```
python password_generator.py
```

This will generate a random password with a length of 12 characters. You can customize the length of the password by passing a different integer value as an argument to the generate_password() function.
## Security

The passwords generated by this program are secure as they include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. However, it is still recommended that you do not use the same password for multiple accounts and change your passwords regularly.
